#### Overview

This week in class we went over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming
concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command
line. Great start! At this point you should be chomping at the bit to _do some Data Science_. If so, good- it's time for Project 1!

For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT scores around the United States. We'll be exploring this data to see what we can learn using the descriptive statistics skills covered this week. Your client, the College Board, is expecting some pretty graphs to add to their presentations this year, so don't let them down!

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Describe your data
- Perform exploratory analysis methods with visualization and statistical analysis
- Use MatPlotLib and Tableau to create visualizations
- Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode
- Determine if dataset appears to follow a normal distribution

**Bonus:**

- Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Tableau
- Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Seaborn
- Create a blog post describing your data, analysis, and approach.


---

#### Necessary Deliverables

- Provide a completed ipython notebook with _all_ of your code.
- All materials must be submitted via a Github PR to the instructor's repo.
- All materials must be submitted by the end of week 1.

---

#### Starter code

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib
for plotting and visualizing our data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping
and quick data analysis. We will discuss more advanced data visualizations for disseminating your work.

Open the starter code instructions in IPython notebook.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Read in your dataset
- Try out a few NumPy commands to describe your data
- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Document **everything**.

### Useful Resources

- [Dataset: sat_scores.csv](./assets/sat_scores.csv)

This data, taken from the College Board, gives the mean SAT math and verbal scores, and the participation rate for each state and the District of Columbia for the year 2001.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
